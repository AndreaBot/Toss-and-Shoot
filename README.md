Toss and Shoot is a rock-paper-scissor game which was created as part of the Day 25 Challenge from the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/2/3/challenge)
but with my own twist: the original challenge required users to play every round by clicking the button showing the winning move based on the shape displayed on the screen.

In this version of the game, players compete against a virtual opponent, making the experience closer to a real-life scenario.

As the player pick a shape, a random one is picked for the opponent, a message at the centre of the screen describes the outcome of the round and a label at the top of screen keeps 
track of the score, which can be reset to zero but a button at the bottom of the screen.
